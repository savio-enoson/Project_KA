Sensors have a limited range of vision.
Cars share information to others within its range.
	Information is given to receiving car as a "hit" in their sensor, with modified offset
	Receiving car then broadcasts its information withing its own range.

* Truncate which sensor to attribute a hit to
* Map controls and add randomness to certain variables
